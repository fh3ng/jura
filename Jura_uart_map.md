# Jura UART Register Map

This document provides an overview of the known **registers (counters)** returned by the `RT:0000` command
for various Jura coffee machine models.  
Each register corresponds to a 4-character hexadecimal field in the response payload (starting from offset `0x03`).

The goal of this table is to consolidate knowledge from community efforts
and to make it easy to correlate specific machine counters with their real-world meanings.

| counter_2 | 0x07 | *Double Espresso / Lungo* | Single Espresso Made | Double Espresso Made | Double Espresso Made | Double Espresso Made |
| counter_3 | 0x0B | *Coffee / Americano* | Single Coffee Made | Coffee Made | Coffee Made | Coffee Made |
| counter_4 | 0x0F | *Normally Double Coffee* | - | Double Coffee Made | Flat White Made | Double Coffee Made |
| counter_5 | 0x13 | *Ristretto/Cappuccino* | Double Espresso Made | – | Cappuccino Made | Ristretto Made |
| counter_6 | 0x17 | *Cappuccino* | - | – | – | Cappuccino Made |
| counter_7 | 0x1B | *Double Ristretto* | - | – | – | Double Ristretto Made |
| counter_8 | 0x1F | *Brew Group Cycles/Rinses* | Rinses Performed | Brews Performed | Rinses Performed | Brew Movements Performed |
| counter_9 | 0x23 | *Cleanings Performed* | Cleanings Performed | Cleanings Performed | Cleanings Performed | Cleanings Performed |
| counter_10 | 0x27 | *Descalings Performed* | Descalings Performed | Descalings Performed | Descalings Performed | Descalings Performed |
| counter_11 | 0x2B | *Brew Group Cycles* | Brew Movements Performed | Brew Movements Performed | – | – |
| counter_12 | 0x2F | *Maybe something to do with Milk* | *increments with Steam Made, resets with descaling* | – | Milk Made | – |
| counter_13 | 0x33 | *Unknown* | *increments with Hot Water, resets with descaling* | – | – | – |
| counter_14 | 0x37 | *Brews/Rinses Since Cleaning/Descaling* | Rinses Performed Since Descaling | – | Brews Since Descaling Performed | – |
| counter_15 | 0x3B | *Grounds Bin Count* | Grounds Level, resets after removing tray | Grounds Level | Grounds Level | Grounds Level |
| counter_16 | 0x3F | *Brews Since Cleaning* | Brews Since Cleaning | – | Brews Since Cleaning Performed | – |

> 💡 **Notes**
> - Offsets shown are relative to the ASCII payload starting at byte `3` of `RT:0000`.
> - Each field is a 4-digit hexadecimal value (`0000`–`FFFF`) representing an unsigned integer.

## 🧩 Other Registers (Non-Counter Commands)

| Command | Description | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| `IC:` | Input/Status Control Flags | Returns 2 bytes (`A` and `B`) with individual bit flags for tray, tank, and brew states. |
| `TT:` | Temperature Test (varies) | Unverified — possible thermal sensor readout. |
| `TY:` | Firmware Version | - |
| `RU:` | Runtime Stats | May return usage hours or cycles (unknown structure). |

## 🔍 Future Work

- [ ] Identify mappings for `counter_5`–`counter_7`, `counter_10`–`counter_14`.
- [ ] Cross-reference with EEPROM layouts of legacy machines (Impressa, ENA Micro).
- [ ] Add derived metrics (e.g., total drinks made, lifetime brew count).
- [ ] Confirm meaning of non-counter registers for models like **ENA8**, **S8**, **Z10**.
